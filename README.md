# 🚗 Training Unit 2: NEDC Simulation

## 🔍 Introduction
This exercise continues from **Training Unit 1** and builds upon your MATLAB knowledge.  
You will learn how to **import, manipulate, and visualize data** in MATLAB using techniques introduced previously.

## 🧭 Preparation
Before starting, make sure you have:
- ✅ Completed the **MATLAB Onramp tutorial**  
- ✅ Reviewed **Section 3 – Technical Background**

## ⚙️ Technical Background
The exercise is based on data from an **electric vehicle (EV)** test bench driven over the **NEDC (New European Driving Cycle)**.  
Your goal is to analyze **energy consumption** and **performance** by importing and processing real-world measurement data.

## ⚡ Vehicle Efficiency Chain
To estimate the EV’s energy demand, consider the system efficiencies:
gy flows **back to the battery** (*recuperation*)

Your implementation should identify both **energy demand** and **recuperation phases** in the data.

## 📊 Objective
Import, process, and visualize the given datasets to evaluate the **energy consumption** and **efficiency behavior** of an electric vehicle during the NEDC drive cycle.
