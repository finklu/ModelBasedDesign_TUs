# 💻 Model-Based Design (MBD)

A course in **ELEKTRONIK UND COMPUTER ENGINEERING** | **WS 2025**

---

## 🎯 Course Overview

This course provides an introduction to **Model-Based Design**, focusing on mathematically modeling physical systems and utilizing simulation tools for verification and code generation.

## 🛠️ Main Topics & Tools

The core of the course revolves around a complete MBD workflow:

* **Modelling:** Deriving mathematical models of physical systems using **differential equations** and **transfer functions**.
* **Simulation & Implementation:** Simulating and analyzing the modeled systems using industry-standard tools:
    * **Matlab & Simulink**
    * **Simscape**
    * **LTSpice**
* **Verification & Code Generation:** Applying the **V-Model** development process (MIL, SIL, HIL) to verify simulation results and generate deployable code for targets like **Arduino**.
* **Software Engineering:** Utilizing **state diagrams** for system logic and **version control (Git/GitHub)** for tracking changes.
